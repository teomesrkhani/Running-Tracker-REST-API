## Running Locally

The application uses Docker Compose to containerize it, eliminating the need to install dependencies like Spring Boot and PostgreSQL. Ensure Docker is installed on your device for Docker Compose to function properly. You can download it [here.](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

```shell
docker-compose up
```

## Tech Used
